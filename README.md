# Tic-Tac-Toe

## A Game Where the Computer Never Loses

This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game which efficiently uses the Minimax algorithm, a type of backtracking algorithm. This algorithm allows the computer to always find an optimal move based on the current condition of the board. It explores all possibilities at each step, assuming that the player is also playing optimally (in order to win).

### How It Works

In this game:

- **If the player chooses X (cross)**, they will always make the first move.
- **By default**, the player moves first.
- **If the player chooses 0 (zero)**, the computer moves first. This setup increases the computer's chance of winning.
